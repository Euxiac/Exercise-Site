//Which of the following console.log messages will print? Why?

if (0) console.log('#1 zero is true')
if ("0") console.log('#2 zero is true')
if (null) console.log('null is true')
if (-1) console.log('negative is true')
if (1) console.log('positive is true')

//Guess is 1 because 1 converts to true. So if true? log it? bc theres no other arguments then.. it's true right?
//Null is a small maybe because if null? if there isnt any other arguments then.. is it null? or null could be converted to false...
//but then again, if false? and there are no other arguments then it is false?
//idk man. lets just go with 1

//Oh I see, all the ones that are numeric would all convert to bool false and true so they would all be acceptable.
